         * of connections and provide an interface to clients to fetch connections from the pool.

		//2. Bridge 
		/*
		 * It separates the abstraction from its implementation.
		 * abstraction : a high level layer, that defines what something does.
		 * implementation : a low level layer, that defines how it does.
		 * 
		 * In a shape drawing system, which can draw different shapes using vector or raster rendering type.
		 * vector (for high-quality scalable graphics) and raster (for pixel-based graphics).
		 * we might create an interface Shape, that will define what it does. draw(), refresh() etc
		 * and shapes circle, rectangle, etc 'is-a' child of Shape.
		 * so each shape must implement its own logic of shape along with how it draws.
		 * to achieve this, it will require to have separate classes :
		 * CircleVector, CircleRaster, RectangleVector, RectangleRaster.
		 * 
		 * Problem : with increase in number of supported shapes and rendering type, we will need to create
		 * more and more classes, hence increased management. 
		 * 
		 * Solution :
		 * Shape is the abstraction because it defines what shapes do but not how theyâ€™re rendered
		 * Renderer is the implementation as it defines how the shapes are drawn (vector, raster, etc.).
		 * 
		 * we must have a separate interface for Rendering, allowing to plug-in new renderer in future.
		 * 
		 * 2. create Implementation : Renderer. (one end of bridge)
		 * 4. create abstraction. : Shape 'has-a' Renderer. (Bridge)
		 * 1. create concrete abstraction : Circle : Shape, Rectangle : Shape etc. (another end of bridge)
		 * 3. create concrete implementations : VectorRenderer : Renderer, RasterRenderer : Renderer.

		 * It deals with hierarchy. when when individual objects, and group of objects should be treated
		 * uniformly.
		 * 
		 * E.g : Entity : grouping shapes : circles, rectangles, lines. and applying same common change to 
		 * that group.
		 * if not used composite design, applying an operation will be required to be done on individual 
		 * shape manually. Eg. circle1.move(3,4) circle2.move(3,4), rectangle1.move(3,4), rectangle2.move(3,4)
		 * etc.
		 * 
		 * Real world : in a graphic design application, we have entities like circle, rectangle.
		 * at initial level, we might want to have a shape class, and circle, rectangle implement it.
		 * now directly exposing shape to clients will not help the client to create groups of shapes, and
		 * apply some common operations on those shapes efficiently.
		 * 
		 * instead, we can create a composite design, and client will use that composition to apply
		 * required operations on groups he created.

		//4. Decorator
		/*
		 * Idea is quite simple. when ever an object can have a usecase of upgrade/downgrade of 
		 * at runtime, then rather than having individual classes of each possible upgraded and
		 * downgraded versions of that object, we build up or build it down (decorate/un-decorate)
		 * the object.
		 * 
		 * E.g : Coffee ordering system.
		 * there can be basic coffee, and there may be add-ons available.
		 * to create a coffee order, user will choose a coffee(baisc) and add some add-ons(decorations) like 
		 * whip, choco-chip, sprinkler, sugar etc.
		 * 
		 * without decorator design classes are: BasicCoffee, CoffeeWithSugar, CoffeeWithWhipedCream,
		 * CoffeeWithChocoChip etc. which is very in flexible, difficult to change/add addons.
		 * 
		 * Decorator : create an interface Coffee (behavior:getPrice, getDescription),
		 * now each individual decorators will 'have-a' Coffee relationship with Coffee.
		 * that means, a composition.

		 * Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
		 * 
		 * E.g : for a crypto buying platform, from client we wish to buy a crypto, but that will require
		 * to use other prerequisite APIs like check current rate, check available balance, etc.

         * The aim is to minimize memory usage as much as possible, by sharing data among the objects

         * E.g : in pubg game, there are thousands of tree, but only limited unique type of trees.

         * there are two types of information in an object : 
         * 1. intrinsic : common/constant to all (core values) 
         * 2. extrinsic : unique to an instance.
         * 
         * NOTE : apply this only when we are sure that certain information is duplicating in each 
         * object. The design is merely for optimization must be used carefully.
         * 
         * Design :
         * Idea is to stop storing the states that rarely changes in actual object, and move that info
         * to separate object and share that object among others.
         * 
         * here, in pubg letsay there are total 1000 trees in cache to be rendered along with other objects.
         * 1000 tree object each tree can be only of a limited type. so let each Tree hold reference to its 
         * type. and a factory should create a pool of flyweight objects of required types.
         * 
         * 1. flyweight : defines the shared interface and intrinsic info.
         * 2. concreteFlyweight : implements the flyweight, holding intrinsic data.

        //1. Strategy Pattern
        /*
         * Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something in a lot of different ways.
         * and extract all of these algorithms into separate classes called Strategies.
         * 
         * The original class called 'context' should have a reference to a strategy. the 'context' delegates
         * the work to a linked strategy instead of executing on its own.
         * 
         * 'Context' is not responsible to selecting a strategy instead client should select what strategy
         * must be used.
         * 
         * Key components : 
         * 1. Strategy interface : a high level operation that can be done in different ways.
         * 2. Concrete strategy : implementations of different ways.
         * 3. context class : holds reference to one of the strategy, and communicates via strategy interface.
         * 
         * E.g : For a online shopping platform, we need to support multiple types of payment methods.
         * when creating first supported payment method, say credit card, rather than directly using an object
         * that takes amount and process the payment, we will use strategy pattern.

         * client should decide the payment strategy.
