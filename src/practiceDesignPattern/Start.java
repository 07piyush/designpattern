		 * E.g pubg game can have different entities like weapons and vehicle.
		 * there may be different regions/environments like dessert, snow, forest etc.
		 * depending on region there can be different type of entities with different behavior.
		 * like a dessertWeapon are sniper category, snowWeapns are machineGuns etc
		 * and a dessertVehicle are suv category, snowVehicle are roller etc
		 * 
		 * so depending on region weapon, vehicle etc entities are related.
		 * 
		 * 1. create abstract products. (entity's general behavior)
		 * 2. create concrete products. (exact entity class : dessertWeapn, snowWeapon etc)
		 * 3. create abstract factory. (based on region will give exact factory for that region)
		 * 4. create concrete factories. (exact factories for each region)
		 * 5. client code : create game environment. environment has weapon, vehicle, etc.
		 * 					client will ask for weapon for dessert or vehicle for dessert etc.

         * singleton pattern ensures there exists exactly one instance of a class throughout the lifecycle.
         * and also provide global point of access for that instance.
         * This instance can be created only when needed. (lazy initialization.)
         * 
         * Best example of singleton is a connection pool manager, since creating a new
         * connection is a time and resources expensive task, so idea is to have a queue
         * of connections and provide an interface to clients to fetch connections from the pool.
         * 
         * since this pool has to be available to all the clients throughout the lifecycle
         * hence there must be only one instance of manager.

		//1. adapter : structural
		//AudioPlayer is already existing class implementing MediaPlayer.
		//Add support of VideoPlayer which has different method signature.

         * E.g 2: adding support of payment gateway.
         * we might want to have support of PhonePe, GPay, paytm etc.
         * each payment platform have their own api for a transaction related tasks.
         * Eg. : PhonePe have : makePayment(long amount)
         * 		 Gpay have : initiatePayment(long amount) and 
         * 		 Paytm may have : startPayment(long amount).
         * 
         * to create maintainable and simple system there must be one interface to interact with
         * all payment platforms. To achieve this, we create an adapter class for each platform.
         * PhonePeAdapter, GpayAdapter, PaytmAdapter. these classes should implement an interface,
         * that contains methods required for payment related operations in our system.

		/*
		 * It separates the abstraction from its implementation.
		 * abstraction : a high level layer, that defines what something does.
		 * implementation : a low level layer, that defines how it does.
		 * 
		 * In a shape drawing system, which can draw different shapes using vector or raster rendering type.
		 * vector (for high-quality scalable graphics) and raster (for pixel-based graphics).
		 * we might create an interface Shape, that will define what it does. draw(), refresh() etc
		 * and shapes circle, rectangle, etc 'is-a' child of Shape.
		 * so each shape must implement its own logic of shape along with how it draws.
		 * to achieve this, it will require to have separate classes :
		 * CircleVector, CircleRaster, RectangleVector, RectangleRaster.
		 * 
		 * Problem : with increase in number of supported shapes and rendering type, we will need to create
		 * more and more classes, hence increased management. 
		 * 
		 * Solution :
		 * Shape is the abstraction because it defines what shapes do but not how theyâ€™re rendered
		 * Renderer is the implementation as it defines how the shapes are drawn (vector, raster, etc.).
		 * 
		 * we must have a separate interface for Rendering, allowing to plug-in new renderer in future.
		 * 
		 * 2. create Implementation : Renderer. (one end of bridge)
		 * 4. create abstraction. : Shape 'has-a' Renderer. (Bridge)
		 * 1. create concrete abstraction : Circle : Shape, Rectangle : Shape etc. (another end of bridge)
		 * 3. create concrete implementations : VectorRenderer : Renderer, RasterRenderer : Renderer.
